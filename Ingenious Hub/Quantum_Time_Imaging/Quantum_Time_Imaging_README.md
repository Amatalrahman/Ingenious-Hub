# Quantum Time Imaging: Breaking Classical Barriers

## Project Overview
Quantum Time Imaging (QTI) is an innovative approach to medical imaging that challenges classical boundaries, focusing on breaking physical laws related to time and energy constraints in conventional imaging devices such as CT, MRI, and X-ray systems. By leveraging quantum principles like entanglement and time dilation, we aim to revolutionize medical diagnostics with high-resolution imaging, reduced radiation exposure, and unprecedented speed.

## Concept
QTI manipulates the relationship between time and quantum states to achieve simultaneous precision in measuring time intervals and energy levels, surpassing the limitations imposed by the **BREAKING LAW OF RELATIVITY**. This breakthrough will allow for enhanced imaging quality and faster diagnostic processes, all while minimizing radiation risks.

## The Broken Law
The key principle we challenge in this project is the **BREAKING LAW OF RELATIVITY**, specifically in the context of time and energy. We hypothesize that quantum conditions can allow for the precise measurement of both time and energy during image capture, thus defying classical limitations.

## Key Features
